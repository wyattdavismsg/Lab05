# Lab 05 - Combinatorial Logic

In this lab, you’ve learned real world applications of digital logic, as well
as how to assemble your own Verilog modules. In addition, you’ve learned how
the constraints file maps your inputs and outputs to real pins on the FPGA.

## Lab Summary
In this lab we learned how to connect two circuits to each other in vivado, then implement the circuit to the physical board to verify the outputs. The lab consisted of connecting the output of circuit a to an input of circuit b. 

## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the role of the Top Level file.

The top level file’s role is to implement the modules onto the board itself by calling the specific LEDs and switches. It also brings all of the modules together into one design.

### 2 - Explain the function of the Constraints file.
The purpose of the constraints file is to assign the variables we use, to the pins that the program knows, as well as assign the voltage level standard of the pins.

### 3 - Was the selection of Minterm and Maxterm correct for each circuit? What would you have chosen?

For circuit A, the selection of maxterms gave the correct result, but it was the wrong choice because there were three times as many maxterms as minterms. I would have chosen minterms for circuit A. For circuit B, there was an even number of minterms and maxterms, so either would be correct. Because I am more comfortable with minterms, I would have chosen those for circuit B as well.
